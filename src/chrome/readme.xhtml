    <h1>Welcome to It's All Text! version @@VERSION@@</h1>
    
    <p> This software is ALMOST version 1.0!</p>

    <p>
      This version is still beta.
    </p>

    <p>
      Upon installation, go to Tools->Addons and select It's All Text and
      set the Preferences.  Specifically, you'll have to set the editor's
      full path.  A future version will automagically pop up preferences
      when you try to edit without an editor set.
    </p>
      
    <p>
      Note to Mac OS X users: Most editors come with a component in
      /usr/bin/, use that as your editor.  If you want to use something
      strange, then create a shell script to do an "open -a /path/to/editor
      $*".
