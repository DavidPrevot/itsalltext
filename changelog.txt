This version is still beta.

Upon installation, go to Tools->Addons and select It's All Text and
set the Preferences.  Specifically, you'll have to set the editor's
full path.  A future version will automagically pop up preferences
when you try to edit without an editor set.

Note to Mac OS X users: Most editors come with a component in
/usr/bin/, use that as your editor.  If you want to use something
strange, then create a shell script to do an "open -a /path/to/editor
$*".
