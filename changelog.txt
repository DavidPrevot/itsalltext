****** 0.3 ******
Second release to addons.mozilla.org (first still not accepted).

This version is still beta.

Upon installation, go to Tools->Addons and select It's All Text and
set the Preferences.  Specifically, you'll have to set the editor's
full path.  A future version will automagically pop up preferences
when you try to edit without an editor set.

Note to Mac OS X users: You'll have to create a shell script to exec
"open -a <your app> $*" so that it'll open correctly.  I haven't had
time to research how to fix this, yet.
