****** 0.2 ******
First release to addons.

This version is very beta.  Upon installation, go to Tools->Addons and
select It's All Text and set the Preferences.  Specifically, you'll
have to set the editor's full path.

Note to Mac OS X users: You'll have to create a shell script to exec
"open -a <your app> $*" so that it'll open correctly.  I haven't had
time to research how to fix this, yet.
