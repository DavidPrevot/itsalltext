# Translating It's All Text!

Hello and thanks for considering adding a translation to *It's All Text!*

Below are several ways to go about updating or creating a new translation.  Use the one you're the most comfortable with.

You can view all of the available locales in [`src/chrome/locale`](https://github.com/docwhat/itsalltext/tree/master/src/chrome/locale).

Because I am only fluent in English, the `en-US` is the "authorative" locale.  I keep it up-to-date with the code.

## Updating a translation

If a locale has English in it still, then you can contribute to *It's All Text!* by forking and submitting pull requests.

Github has excellent instructions for this:

* [Forking a repository](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo)
* [Submitting a Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests)

### Github's editor

Once you've forked `itsalltext` then you can go in the `src/chrome/locale` directory.  Find the directory matching the language
you're willing to update.  Once there, you can edit files by clicking on them and then clicking "Edit".

Github has some help for this:

* [Creating and editing files in your repository](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-editing-files-in-your-repository)

Once you're done, submit a Pull Request.  I'll double check everything and then the next version of *It's All Text!* will your
translations!

### Git

If you're comfortable with `git`, then you should know how this goes.  If you're new to `git` but still want to use it, then I suggest reading
github's guides at [help.github.com](https://help.github.com/).

## A Completely new translation

If you're a `git` user, just copy the `en-US` locale and use it for your starting point.  Remind me it is a new locale so I remember to add
it to the `install.rdf` (or you can add it yourself and save me from making a mistake).

If you aren't comfortable with `git` then I can mail you a copy of the `en-US` locale and you can email me the resulting translation!

To contact me, just use [my mail form](https://docwhat.org/email/).
